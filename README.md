# Dotfiles

Truly a labour of love, and a time capsule. I use these files on every computer
I run, and they support the computers I run, kind of by definition. That's
macOS and a little bit of Fedora.

Everything in here certainly was used at some point, but right now, the things
I am most maintaining are:

+ zsh
+ git
+ vim
+ bat
+ iterm
+ liquidprompt

In addition to this, you can find a few little scripts I use in the `bin`
directory, and some Python scripts to support those in lib.
